"""
Core utilities for gas-benchmarks scripts.

This package consolidates the helper functionality that used to live in the
monolithic ``utils.py`` module so that individual scripts can depend on small,
well-scoped helpers.  The legacy ``utils`` module now simply re-exports these
symbols to remain backward compatible.
